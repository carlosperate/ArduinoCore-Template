# Arduino Core Template

This is a template to create an Arduino Core (an Arduino port into a new board
or platform).

This template is currently under development, so it is not complete. As part
of that, the documentation might not be complete either.
Nevertheless, if you are creating a new Arduino Core, you can probably take
what is already on here as a base, and go from there.


## Information used to populate project files

- Vendor name: `vendorname`
- Maintainer: `Your Name`
- Core full name: `Arduino Core Template`
- Architecture: `template-arch`
    - This is the processor architecture for the core, e.g. `avr`, `samd`, etc.
- Board 1 name: `Arduino Core Template Board One`
- Board 2 name: `Arduino Core Template Board Two`
- Version: `0.0.1`
    - All versions should follow
      [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- Docs: https://carlosperate.github.io/ArduinoCore-Template/docs


## Directory Structure

- `.github`: This folder contains a GitHub Action to do cody style check using
  ClangFormat, and a GitHub Action Workflow to run it on each commit.
- `cores`: This folder contains the Arduino Core C/C++ source code (the files
  that implement the Arduino API and libraries).
- `docs`: This folder is not part of the Arduino Core, but it is used to be
  able host static files online via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
  This is needed to provide a JSON file URL to the Arduino IDE, so that the
  IDE can install the Arduino Core.
- `custom-tools`: This folder and its contents are **not necessary** for the
  Arduino Core. They contain a hello world program, compiled to a wide range
  of platforms to use it as an example showing how to integrate custom tools
  (like compilers, build tools, or debuggers, etc) with the your Arduino core.


## Special Files

- `boards.txt`: Defines the Arduino boards for this core.
- `platform.txt`: Defines how the Arduino IDE/CLI use the tooling to build
  and upload with this core.
- `docs/package_info.json`: This files is not packaged inside the Arduino Core,
  and it is instead hosted online using GitHub Pages. This file contains the
  information required by the Arduino IDE/CLI to be able to install the Arduino
  Core into their environment.
  The URL to this files is added by the user to the Arduino IDE, so that the
  Arduino Board Manager can install this Core.
  More information can be found in the `docs/README.md` file.
- `programmers.txt`: Contain definitions to use external programmers, for
  example to flash a bootloader (which is usually only required once) or to
  flash a compiled Arduno Sketch.
- `keywords.txt`: WIP.


## Installing

### Install for development

These are the development instructions:
1. Locate the Arduino `SKETCHBOOK` directory, which depends on your Operating
  System:
    - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino`
    - macOS: `~/Documents/Arduino`
    - Linux: `~/Arduino`
2. Clone this repository in the following `SKETCHBOOK` subdirectory:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/carlosperate/ArduinoCore-Template.git <SKETCHBOOK>/hardware/vendorname/template/
  ```
3. Open (or restart)  the Arduino IDE
4. The "Arduino Core Template Boards" option should now appear in the
  `tools/board` menu.


### Install as a user

As this is just a template, it is not intended to be used directly by users.
However, for your own release of an Arduino Core, these would an example
of the user instructions:

- Download, install, and start the Arduino IDE
- Open the IDE preferences or settings
- In the "Additional boards manager URLs" section add the following URL:
  `https://carlosperate.github.io/ArduinoCore-Template/docs/package_YourName_ArduinoCoreTemplate_index.json`
- Open the Board Manager from the `tools/board` menu.
- Find the "Arduino Core Template" core and click its "Install" button
- Done! ðŸŽ‰
  You can now select the "Arduino Core Template" from the `tools/board` menu.

## Arduino IDE minimum version

Some of the features used in this template are not available in earlier version
of the Arduino IDE, so the currently minimum version is:

- 1.6.6
